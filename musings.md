## Grub
To automatically boot the saved boot entry, edit `/etc/default/grub` by 
changing `GRUB_DEFAULT=saved` and adding `GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true`.

To automatically open the grub menu every time, comment out 
`GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden` and set `GRUB_TIMEOUT=5` to give you 5 seconds
to choose a boot option.

## Git

### Stage file or directory modifications/additions
```bash
git add <file-or-directory>
```

### Stage all modifications/additions
```bash
git add .
```

### Stage all changes (including deletions)
```bash
git add -A
```

### Stage all files for removal
```bash
git rm -r --cached .
```
Useful for removing deleted or ignored files from the index. Typically followed
by:
```bash
git add .
```
to re-stage any unstaged files.

### Unstage files
```bash
git restore --staged .
```
Useful for removing staged files that you've accidentally added or recently
ignored (can be followed by `git add .` to re-stage the files you want to
keep).

**Note:** This will not remove already committed files from the index. Use
`git rm` to remove committed files.

### Uncommit last commit

git reset --soft "HEAD~1"
```
### Add submodules

git submodule add <repository> <path>
